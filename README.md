# Stanford CS229 Machine Learning in Python
This repository contains the problem sets as well as the solutions for the Stanford CS229 - Machine Learning course on Coursera written in Python 3. Some additional notes taken by me are also included.

Please check out the [course website](http://cs229.stanford.edu/) and the [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning).

Please note that your solutions won't be graded and are not affiliated to Coursera in any way. If your answers differ from mine and you argue that yours are better, please create an issue on [GitHub](https://www.github.com/rickwierenga/CS229-Pytohon).

## Installation
Make sure you have jupyter notebooks installed. You can find instructions [here](https://jupyter.org/install). 

The following Python packages are used:
* [Numpy](https://www.numpy.org)
* [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org)
* [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
* [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org)
* [Pillow](https://python-pillow.org)
* [Natural Language Toolkit](http://www.nltk.org)

You can install all dependencies using:
```shell
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Instructions
1. Please download the exercises (pdf) from the Coursera course. Some instructions are included in the Notebooks. 
2. Complete the exercises in the exercises Notebook.
3. Compare your answers to the code in solutions Notebook.
